MAJOR:
* Switching chapters
* Item materials
* Useable items
* Container items
* Extend crafting struct to be something more than mere recipes container(proficiency points, etc.)
* Documentation for XML data files: armors, skills, areas, objects, quests, recipes, effects, savegame
* Documentation for directories: data, savegames, module/objects, chapter/objects, recipes, areas,
  effects, skills, npc, areas, area
* Package to parse JSON data files(parsejson, like parsexml), to replace XML data files with JSON files

MINOR:
* More examples
* Improve combat system(include resilience, stats bonuses, etc.)
* Improve NPC AI(selecting skills proper to situation)
* Refactor chapter's SetOnAreaAddedFunc to AddOnAreaAddedFunc, i.e. adding event functions,
  not just handling and overriding one function
* Use sync.Map to store area objects(and subareas?)
* Exporting character exports also quests, effects, items, etc., its desirable for save game,
  but other marshaling method should be applied for exporting character to use in different game
* Rename quest.Journal to QuestLog(quest.Log?), journal could be something else
* Tests for parsexml and data packages
* Camelcase names for consts in: quest, skill
* Remove stage modifiers from dialog, modifiers should be passed only through
  stage answers
* XML: rename talker node in dialog to target
* Item modifier
