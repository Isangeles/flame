MAJOR:
* Switching chapters
* Item materials
* Extend crafting struct to be something more than mere recipes container(proficiency points, etc.)
* Documentation for XML data files: armors, weapons, skills, dialogs, areas, objects,
  quests, recipes, effects, savegame
* Documentation for directories: data, savegames, modules, module, chapters, chapter,
  items, module/objects, chapter/objects, recipes, areas, effects, skills, npc, dialogs,
  areas, area
MINOR:
* More examples
* Improve combat system(include resilience, stats bonuses, etc.)
* Improve NPC AI(selecting skills proper to situation)
* Remove generateSerials function from chapter struct
* Refactor chapter's SetOnAreaAddedFunc to AddOnAreaAddedFunc, i.e. adding event functions,
  not just handling and overriding one function
* Use sync.Map to store area objects(and subareas?)
* Exporting character exports also quests, effects, items, etc., its desirable for save game,
  but other marshaling method should be applied for exporting character to use in different game
* Rename quest.Journal to QuestLog(quest.Log?), journal could be something else
* Tests for parsexml and data packages
* Camelcase names for consts in: quest, skill
* Rename module config files(mod.conf, chapter.conf) to .mod, .chapter, etc.
* Injecting characters names in dialog texts
* Remove stage modifiers from dialog, modifiers should be passed only through
  stage answers
