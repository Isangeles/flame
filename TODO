MAJOR:
* Switching chapters
* Item materials
MINOR:
* More examples
* Improve combat system(include resilience, stats bonuses, etc.)
* Improve NPC AI(selecting skills proper to situation)
* Remove generateSerials function from chapter struct
* Refactor chapter's SetOnAreaAddedFunc to AddOnAreaAddedFunc, i.e. adding event functions, not just handling and overriding one function
* Use sync.Map to store area objects(and subareas?)
* Exporting character exports also quests, effects, items, etc., its desirable for save game, but other marshaling method should be applied for exporting character to use in different game
* Merge SaveGame struct from save to res package
* As for now, to create character from whole data(with equipment, skills, etc.) you need to use data.Character function, this should be changed to enable character constructor(character.New) to build character from whole data
* Rename quest.Journal to QuestLog(quest.Log?), journal could be something else
