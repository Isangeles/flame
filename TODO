MAJOR:
* Switching chapters
* Item materials

* Documentation for XML data files: armors, weapons, skills, dialogs, areas, objects,
  quests, recipes, effects, savegame

  items, module/objects, chapter/objects, recipes, areas, effects, skills, npc, dialogs,
  areas, area

* More examples
* Improve combat system(include resilience, stats bonuses, etc.)
* Improve NPC AI(selecting skills proper to situation)
* Remove generateSerials function from chapter struct

  not just handling and overriding one function

* Exporting character exports also quests, effects, items, etc., its desirable for save game,
  but other marshaling method should be applied for exporting character to use in different game

* Tests for parsexml and data packages
* Camelcase names for consts in: quest, skill
* Rename module config files(mod.conf, chapter.conf) to .mod, .chapter, etc.
* Injecting characters names in dialog texts
* Adding experience to character after killing other character/object

  through e.g. onHealthMod function
