## Introduction
  Flame is RPG game engine written from scratch in Go.

  The main goal is to create simple, flexible, extensible and completely modular game engine.
  
  Flame is able to create all game objects from textual data, this guarantees that game data is easy to modify and extend.
  
  This repository contains engine core API, which allows to load game module data from textual format, create and modify game objects, and export game module data back into textual format.

  Easiest way to create a game with Flame is to download some graphical or textual fronted(like [Mural](https://github.com/isangeles/mural) or [Burn Shell](https://github.com/isangeles/burnsh)) and create module or use some existing one.

  Flame modules are available for download [here](http://flame.isangeles.pl/mods).

  The project idea is based on [Senlin](https://github.com/isangeles/senlin) game engine.

  Currently in an early development stage.

  Flame as a project consists with many different repositories, some of them are independent and can be reused in other projects:

  * [Flame](https://github.com/Isangeles/flame) - engine core API
  * [Burn](https://github.com/Isangeles/burn) - commands interpreter with it's own scripting language [Ash](https://github.com/Isangeles/burn/tree/master/ash) for creating cutscenes etc.
  * [Fire](https://github.com/Isangeles/fire) - TCP server that enables creating multiplayer games
  * [Ignite](https://github.com/Isangeles/ignite) - AI program for the Fire server
  * [Burnsh](https://github.com/Isangeles/burnsh) - textual fronted(CLI)
  * [Mural](https://github.com/Isangeles/mural) - graphical fronted(2D GUI)
  * [MTK](https://github.com/Isangeles/mtk) - simple graphical toolkit
  * [Stone](https://github.com/Isangeles/stone) - simple library to render [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) maps
  * [Arena](https://github.com/Isangeles/arena) - example Flame module

  ### Example games:
  #### Arena ####

  Description: simple demo game based on [Arena](https://github.com/isangeles/arena) module with [Mural GUI](https://github.com/isangeles/mural) support.

## Usage
You can find usage examples in [example](https://github.com/Isangeles/flame/tree/master/example) package.

## Modules
Modules contain all game data in the form of textual files. Modules are divided into chapters, that's contains chapter-specific data.

Modules are stored by default in `data/modules` directory.

Module data are available across all chapters, data files are placed in sub-directories(`/items`, `/objects`, etc.) in the module directory.

Chapter data are available only when a specific chapter is active, data files are placed in sub-directories(`/characters`, `/dialogs`, etc.) in chapter directory(in `[module]/chapters`).

Translation files are placed in `/lang` directory both for modules and chapters.

The example module is available [here](https://github.com/Isangeles/arena).

## Documentation
Source code documentation can be easily browsed with `go doc` command.

Documentation of configuration files and data files in the form of Troff pages is available under `doc` directory.

You can easily view documentation pages with `man` command.

For example to display documentation page for character data files:
```
$ man doc/characters
```

Note that documentation of data files is still incomplete.
