## Introduction
  Flame is RPG game engine written from scratch in Go.

  The main goal is to create simple, flexible, extensible and completely modular game engine.
  Flame parses readable text files and creates game objects, this means that all game data is easy to modify and extend.

  Easiest way to use Flame is to download some kind graphical or textual interface, like [Mural](https://github.com/isangeles/mural)(GUI) or [Burn Shell](https://github.com/isangeles/burnsh)(CLI).

  The project idea is based on [Senlin](https://github.com/isangeles/senlin) game engine.

  Flame modules are available for download [here](http://flame.isangeles.pl/mods).

  Currently in a very early development stage.
