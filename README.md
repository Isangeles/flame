## Introduction
  Flame is RPG game engine written from scratch in Go.
  
  The main goal is to create simple, flexible, extensible and completely modular game engine.
  Flame parses readable text files and creates game objects, this means that all game data is easy to modify and extend.

  Engine provides build-in CLI frontend to easy run and debug modules. Engine does not come with any graphical interface, instead is designed to be used with external GUI's(e.g. [Mural](https://github.com/isangeles/mural)).
  
  The project idea is based on [Senlin](https://github.com/isangeles/senlin) game engine.

  Flame modules are available for download [here](http://flame.isangeles.pl/mods).
  
  Currently in a very early development stage.
