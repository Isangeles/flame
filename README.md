## Introduction
  Flame is RPG game engine written from scratch in Go.

  The main goal is to create simple, flexible, extensible and completely modular game engine.
  Flame parses readable text files and creates game objects, this means that all game data is easy to modify and extend.

  Easiest way to create a game with Flame is to download some graphical or textual fronted(like [Mural](https://github.com/isangeles/mural) or [Burn Shell](https://github.com/isangeles/burnsh)) and create module or modify existing one(like [Arena](https://github.com/Isangeles/arena)).

  The project idea is based on [Senlin](https://github.com/isangeles/senlin) game engine.

  Flame modules are available for download [here](http://flame.isangeles.pl/mods).

  Currently in a early development stage.

  Flame as a project consists with many different repositories, some of them are independent and can be reused in other projects:

  * [Flame](https://github.com/Isangeles/flame) - engine core
  * [Burn](https://github.com/Isangeles/burn) - commands interpreter with it's own scripting language [Ash](https://github.com/Isangeles/burn/tree/master/ash) for creating cutscenes etc.
  * [Burnsh](https://github.com/Isangeles/burnsh) - textual fronted(CLI)
  * [Mural](https://github.com/Isangeles/mural) - graphical fronted(2d GUI)
  * [MTK](https://github.com/Isangeles/mtk) - simple graphical toolkit
  * [Stone](https://github.com/Isangeles/stone) - simple library to render [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) maps
  * [Arena](https://github.com/Isangeles/arena) - example Flame module

  ### List of games that use Flame:
  #### Arena ####

  Description: simple demo game based on [Arena](https://github.com/isangeles/arena) module with [Mural GUI](https://github.com/isangeles/mural) support.

## Usage
  You can find usage examples in [example](https://github.com/Isangeles/flame/tree/master/example) package.

## Configuration
Configuration values are loaded from `.flame` file in Flame executable directory.

### Configuration values:
```
  lang:[language ID];
```
Description: specifies game language, language ID is name of directory with translation files in lang directories(e.g. `data/lang` or `data/modules/[mod]/lang`).

```
  module:[module ID];[module path](optional);
```
Description: specifies module to load at start, module ID is ID specified in `mod.conf` file inside main module directory, module path is optional and stands for module directory path, if not provided engine will search default modules path(`data/modules`).

```
  debug:[true/false];
```
Description: enables engine debug mode(shows debug messages in engine log), 'true' enables mode, everything else sets mode disabled.

## Modules
Modules are stored by default in `data/modules` directory, different path to module can be specified in engine configuration file(`.flame`).

Modules contains all game data in form of textual files. Modules are divided into chapters, thats contains chapter-specific data.

Module data are available across all chapters, data files are placed subdirectories(`/items`, `/objects`, etc.) in module directory.

Chapter data are available only when specific chapter is active, data files are placed in subdirectories(`/npc`, `/dialogs`, etc.) in chapter directory(in `[module]/chapters`).

Translation files are placed in `/lang` directory both for modules and chapters.

Example module is available [here](https://github.com/Isangeles/arena).

## Documentation
Documentation of configuration files and data files in the form of troff pages is available under `doc/data` directory.

You can easily view documentation pages with `man` command.

For example to display documentation page for XML data files with characters:
```
$ man doc/data/files/xml/.characters
```

Note that documentation is still incomplete.
